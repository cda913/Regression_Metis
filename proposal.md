# Proposal

## Question
Fred and Mabel Yarns wants to know how much to price their knitting patterns for. I will used data from ravelry.com to find a good price for the patterns of various items (hat, scarf, glove, etc.) 

## Tools
I will use BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from ravelry.com's patterns, Pandas to clean the data, and matplotlib or seaborn to display the data. Features will include 9 of the 11 categories on each project page ("craft", "category", "yarn weight", "gauge", "needle size", "yardage", "sizes available", "languages"), number of projects, the tags, and the price. The final presentation will have a graph showing the data, and a table that will list type of item and recommended price to sell the pattern for. 

## MVP 
MVP will be a graph of "category" vs. price
