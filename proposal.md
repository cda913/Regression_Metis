# Proposal

## Question
Samuel of Fred and Mabel Yarns wants to know how much to price his knitting patterns for sweaters. I will used data from Ravelry.com to find a good price for the patterns, given the various features of the finished product. 

## Tools
I will use BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from Ravelry.com's patterns, Pandas to clean the data, and matplotlib and seaborn to display the data. Features will include 7 of the 11 categories on each project page ("craft", "yarn weight", "gauge", "needle size", "yardage", "sizes available", "languages"), number of projects, and the tags, with the price as the target. The final presentation will have a graph showing the data. 

## MVP 
MVP will be a graph of "yarn weight" vs. price
